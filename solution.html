```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    This is a red box.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    This is a blue box.
  </div>
</div>
```
This fixes the overlapping issue by allocating half the available width to each div using `w-1/2`.  Alternative solutions could involve using `flex-grow`, specifying explicit heights, or using other width utilities.
